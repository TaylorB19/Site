  <h1>What are the three main image formats?</h1>

<h2>The three main formats are PNG, JPEG, and GIF</h2>



<p><b><u>GIF-</u></b>GIFs are commonly used on the web as an easy way to incorporate graphics into a website with a very low file size. The problem with GIFs is that it can only use 256 colors. Many people do not like this as they believe it is hard to recreate a real life scene with only 256 colors. GIFs are bad when trying to transition from one color to the next. GIFs area good for images with solid colors and few gradients.

<p><b><u>JPEG-</u></b>JPEGs are the best option with working with complex effects and photography. Using JPEGs gives you the option to adjust the quality to alter the file size. With lower qualities comes worse transitions between colors and through gradients, the higher the quality the better, but it would also take up more file space.

<p><b><u>PNG-</u></b>There are 2 common types of PNGs. One being a PNG-8 and one being PNG-24. PNG-8s and GIFs are very similar, they both offer only 256 colors, therefore have the same limits on gradients and quality. The only difference is that PNG-8 may offer a smaller file size. PNG-24s are slightly more complex as they can offer a much higher image quality and can be better at altering transparency. PNGs are good for file sizes, but they are not supported by all web browsers which makes them less common than the other two types of images. PNGs are commonly used on photoshop aswell.
